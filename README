This is the source code for kaggle driver telematic analysis problem.

Strategy :

1. Create difference vector of each trip.
2. Upsample to a common length
3. Take fourier transform.
4. Assume a gaussian generative model and calculate the probability of occurence.

Cross-Validation Strategy :
1. Do k-fold cross validation from python libraries.
2. GBRT, SVM, LOgistic regression and then forrest of classifiers
3. Feature engineering
4. Creating the training and test set is a challenge, assume that the models are resistant to a few outliers.
